I~want to thank the members of the ParaDiSe laboratory for nice, even if not always particularly work-friendly environment.
In particular, I want to thank my supervisor, Jiří, for discussions about my research topics, help with papers, and trying to keep me on the track while also grudging respecting that I~cannot devote all my time to research.
I~want to thank Mornfall for his consultations, programming insights, inputs to research topics, and help with papers, especially in the first half of my PhD and in my bachelor and master studies.
I~want to thank Nikola for being an inspiration in both depth and breadth of knowledge, for the energy he puts into teaching, and for the long discussions on various topics.
I~want to thank Martin J. for being an inspiration in what a PhD student can achieve, for his indispensable insights to teaching materials and also for the long discussions.
Furthermore, I~want to thank \mbox{Red Hat} for the support of my research.
I~am also thankful for the opportunity to teach during my studies at the faculty -- it was an important contributor in my carrier choices and allowed me to meet many interesting people.

However, this thesis would not exist without many people who did not participate in the research and without additional opportunities I~had.
I~want to thank my closest family for the support they gave me during the long course of my studies.
My thanks go to many members and former members of ParaDiSe and Formela laboratories, many of whom are much more than just colleagues.
My thanks also go to my friends in the Friends of Nordic Animals Association\kern-0.3em\mnote[\icon{zverinec}]{Spolek přátel severské zvěře} and to this association in general.
Furthermore, I~am thankful to Instruktoři Brno for providing the much-needed counter-balance to my research activities in the last hard year. In particular I~want to thank \icon[\heightof{a}]{isb}, {\small\icon{isb}}, and \icon{isb} for organizing the 2019/2020 course, to all the participants of this course and to all the people who organized its events.
Big thanks go to Martin~U. and Katka~S. for really listening to me when I~needed it a lot.
Finally, I~am pretty sure this list is not complete… well, a complete list would probably be too long anyway.
